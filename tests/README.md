# tests

The tests consist of three test sets
 - `test-set-1/` - tests provided by [prof. Maciej Gębala](https://cs.pwr.edu.pl/gebala/) + specific feature tests
 - `test-set-2/` - simple programs imitating real-life usage
 - `gijoop-tests/` - tests kindly provided by [gijoop](https://github.com/gijoop/jftt-compiler)


> [!NOTE]
if the tests somehow don't work, see `config.json` and configure all paths so they match your current directory
